d3-bilevelLabelTooltip
======================

This is a modified d3js bilevel partition in which labels and tooltips were added.

The idea is to have an abbreviation of the partition displayed and a fancier description with the number on the tooltip.

The base for this chart was (Mike's Bilevel Partition)[http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371].
Tooltips thanks to (Sharon Howard)[http://sharonhoward.org/ob/punzoomsunbursttt.html]
