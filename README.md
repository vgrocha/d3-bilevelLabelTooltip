d3-bilevelLabelTooltip
======================

This is a modified d3js bilevel partition in which labels and tooltips were added.

The idea is to have an abbreviation of the partition displayed and a
tooltip with a fancier description and the size of that partition.

The base for this chart was [Mike's Bilevel Partition](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371).
Tooltips thanks to [Sharon Howard](http://sharonhoward.org/ob/punzoomsunbursttt.html)
